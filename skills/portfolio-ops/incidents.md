# Incidents

> **Append only. Never delete.** New entries go at the bottom. Do not edit or remove an earlier entry; if it turns out to be wrong, add a new entry that corrects it and links back by date.

This is the log Kalp asked for: every time something goes wrong, it is written down here so the next agent can see whether it has happened before and what fixed it. It exists because the same failure tends to recur on free tiers (paused databases, expired tokens, DNS records flipped to proxied) and the second diagnosis should take minutes, not hours.

## What counts as an incident

Record an entry for any of these, even if it was fixed in thirty seconds:

- A production hiccup: a site down, a health route failing, a database paused, a subdomain not resolving, analytics not arriving, a deploy that failed.
- A verifier FAIL on any task.
- A reviewer rejection that revealed a real bug (not a style nit).
- A surprise during a runbook: a command that did not behave as the runbook said.
- Anything that cost or nearly cost money.

Do not record: planned work, design decisions (those go in `STATUS.md` "Decisions log"), or style-only review comments.

## Entry template

Copy this block verbatim and fill every field. "Unknown" is an acceptable value for root cause if it was never found; leaving a field out is not.

```
### YYYY-MM-DD: <one-line symptom>

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD (and time with timezone if it matters)
- **Affected:** <host / app / service>
- **Symptom:** What was observed, exactly. Include the failing URL, command, or error text.
- **What was tried:** Each step in order, including the ones that did not work.
- **Root cause:** The actual cause, not the first theory. Say "Unknown" if never found.
- **Fix:** What resolved it, with the exact command or dashboard action.
- **Prevention:** What was changed so it does not recur: a runbook edit, a monitor, a test, a settings-map row. Link the file that changed.
- **Reported by:** worker / reviewer / verifier / Kalp / UptimeRobot

### 2026-09-18: promptflip has two Vercel projects and the locally-linked one is the broken one

- **Date:** 2026-09-18, ~14:40 EDT (found during T0.2 Step 1, before any deletion)
- **Affected:** promptflip on Vercel (team `kks-projects-2edcb11a`): projects `promptflip` (prj_rSr9QbGDbB2FLOeAAilYmqO5DKL1, the one `~/projects/promptflip/.vercel/project.json` links to) and `promptflip-35qv` (prj_t2eXoIxI2HN3snfyFpGAkTqHa4VD).
- **Symptom:** The plan assumed `promptflip` was live and `promptflip-35qv` was a stray duplicate to delete. The opposite is true:

  | | `promptflip-35qv` | `promptflip` (linked locally) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Git link | KalpKan/promptflip, branch main | KalpKan/promptflip, branch main |
  | Production deployment | dpl_4GkXsM4AYFbeQPLsRtEJFpyNh1ah, **READY**, built 2026-09-12 14:24 EDT | dpl_5YrUnBv8UMaL7GhNX4CCK6hmzHkp, **ERROR**, 2026-09-12 14:24 EDT (the newest); the one before it, dpl_4sLrEupHx6wyVkoNJhRWNsDPJeAs, `Canceled` (13:30 EDT); all 14 production deployments are Error or Canceled, none Ready |
  | `https://<name>.vercel.app` | 200 | 404 `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` (both `promptflip-kks-projects-2edcb11a.vercel.app` and `promptflip.vercel.app`) |
  | `/api/health` | `{"ok":true,"db":"ok",...,"commit":"aff55a5","region":"pdx1"}` | `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` |
  | Env var names | NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (production only), NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET, CRON_SECRET | same six, all on production+preview |

- **What was tried:** `npx vercel project ls`; `npx vercel inspect` on both production URLs (the `promptflip` one errors with "Can't find the deployment"); `curl` on `/` and `/api/health` for both; `npx vercel env ls` from `~/projects/promptflip` (read-only) and the Vercel REST API `GET /v9/projects/<name>` and `/env` (names only) for both projects.
- **Root cause:** Unknown exactly, but the shape is clear: the promptflip repo was imported into Vercel twice (Vercel appends `-35qv` when the name is taken), both auto-deploy from `main`, the second import is the one whose builds succeed, and the local `vercel link` was done against the first. None of `promptflip`'s 14 production builds has ever reached Ready (all Error or Canceled).
- **Fix:** Not fixed; it needs Kalp's decision. `promptflip-35qv` was **not** deleted and `promptflip` was left alone. Only `tokengamblecoinflip` was removed in T0.2. Raised as human checkpoint **H5** in `STATUS.md`. Nothing inside `~/projects/promptflip` was changed.
- **Prevention:** Runbook "Delete a Vercel project" in `runbooks.md` now requires the health-route, `inspect` and env/Git-link comparison before any `project rm`, and names the projects that must never be deleted. Until H5 is resolved: every push to promptflip `main` burns two Hobby builds; any `npx vercel` command run from `~/projects/promptflip` (env changes, deploys, `vercel env pull`) targets the broken project; the T0.4 domain work and the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` / Supabase redirect updates must target `promptflip-35qv`. Also: `npx vercel project rm` in CLI 59.23.2 rejects `--yes` (the plan's command); the runbook uses `printf 'y\n' |` instead.
